## something to use Steamworks.net Faster

# Description
This is the __first version__<sub>V0.1.0</sub> of my lib based on [Steamworks.Net](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/) so you should have some amount of knowledge anyway, some of the code is commented out for debugging, so let's just say maybe one day I'll add my own debugging tool to make it easier for dev's.

>[!NOTE]
>You should use [steamworks.net.dll](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/) and steam_api64.dll for this shðŸ¤¬t
